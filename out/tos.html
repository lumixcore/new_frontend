While we aim to maintain reliable and stable service, we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, performance, or uptime. LumixCore reserves the right to modify, limit, suspend, or discontinue any service or feature at any time, with or without notice.</p><h2>4.

No refunds will be provided for any reason and users are responsible for sending payments to the correct address.</p><h2>7. Suspension &amp; Termination</h2><p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts at any time, with or without notice. Suspension or termination may result in loss of access to services and user data. LumixCore is not responsible for any data loss or service disruption resulting from such actions.</p><h2>8.

Service Availability &amp; Disclaimer (As-Is, Best Effort)</h2><p>We aim to provide stable and reliable services; however, all services are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service and may occasionally experience downtime, maintenance, updates, or interruptions. Scheduled maintenance will be communicated when possible, but users acknowledge that temporary interruptions may occur without notice.
